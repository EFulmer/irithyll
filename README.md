# irithyll
Using Python to play around with logic stuff.

Inspired by the [Nand2Tetris MOOC.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) However, solutions to actual exercises will **not** be present here, whether in Python or HDL, as requested by the instructors!

As for where the name came from... I enjoy using _Dark Souls_ themed names for my personal repositories, and IR = intermediate representation. It mostly just sounds nice.
